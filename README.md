## 1. Atomic Stages
-Crash random atoms in to each other. Plot a spot and make random molecules. AI-SKYE will guide the user with a checklist of things to make.  
-Once the list has been completed, the user gets a new list and repeats the process.  Only that instead of atoms, it's the molecules from the last list.  AI-SKYE will also guide the user through this part as well.
-Once the list thas been completed, the user gets a new list. except this time you connect different molecule and atoms to create compoud elements.  Success in this stage would be to complete a list of amino acids
